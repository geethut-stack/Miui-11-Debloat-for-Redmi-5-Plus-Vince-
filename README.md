DISCLAIMER: USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, I customized this list to my own needs

*If anything problems and necessities occur, you can always re-enable APPS in settings or ADB*

*Packages are NOT UNINSTALLED BUT DISABLED*

This debloat list is for Redmi 5 Plus (vince) on Miui 11 (miui_HM5PlusGlobal_V11.0.2.0.OEGMIXM_f74369de0c_8.1)

List of all packages are exported from newly installed Miui using:  adb shell pm list package

Omitted packages to be disabled are marked: #

EVERYTHING that can be DISABLED is DISABLED (tested many times)

Packages I need which are not disabled:
1. Phone, Contacts, Messages App and Services (if you have your own contacts and phone app you can disable these APPS - NOT SERVICES)
2. Miui Security App and Services
3. Gallery
4. Bluetooth services
5. Location service (except for xiaomi fused location)

WARNING: 
1. GOOGLE SERVICES and DEPENDENCIES are removed so any APP requiring google services MIGHT NOT WORK
2. File manager and keyboard disabled, so have your own APK ready for install

Please:
Leave questions and feedback if any
